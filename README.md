**üéà Usable for people who want to spawn random mob on their posistion at anytime**

**‚û° Use /randommob to spawn a random mob at the location you are.**

# Here's a part of the code of this plugin:

```java
private final List<EntityType> spawnableMobs = Arrays.stream(EntityType.values())
        .filter(type -> type.isAlive() && type.isSpawnable())
        .filter(type -> type != EntityType.ENDER_DRAGON
                && type != EntityType.WITHER
                && type != EntityType.WARDEN)
        .toList();
```
